# Retailer-Assistant
This is my senior capstone project Online Retailer Asistant. It's purpose is to take in user queries and search filters to scrape online retailers. This way you can let the program run in the background and find good deals for you. It is currently cappable of searching through Ebay, Ruby Lane, and Property Room. The project is set up so even intro level coders can add more website for the program to scrape. If you want to modify this project or just check out its code please go to my dev repository: https://github.com/torgvad/Retailer-Assistant-Dev-Version.
